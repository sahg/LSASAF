Utilities for reading LSA-SAF product files.

This module contains some functions for reading the data products produced by
the Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility
(https://landsaf.ipma.pt/). The data products are distributed in HDF5 format
and therefore the module requires the h5py package. Numpy is also used.
